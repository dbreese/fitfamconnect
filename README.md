Night of January 16th is a play by Ayn Rand inspired by the death of Ivar Kreuger, an industrialist and accused swindler
known as the Match King. The play is set in a courtroom during a murder trial and audience members are chosen to play
the jury. The court hears the case of Karen Andre, a former secretary and lover of businessman Bjorn Faulkner, of whose
murder she is accused. The jury must rely on character testimony to decide whether Andre is guilty; the play's ending
depends on their verdict. Rand wanted to dramatize a conflict between individualism and conformity. The play was first
produced in 1934 in Los Angeles under the title Woman on Trial. Producer A. H. Woods took it to Broadway for the 1935â€“36
season and re-titled it Night of January 16th (flyer pictured). It became a hit and ran for seven months. The play has
been adapted as a film, as well as for television and radio. Rand had many disputes with Woods over the play, and in
1968 re-edited it for publication as her "definitive" version.

Ethan entered the store, the cool air a relief from the heat. He grabbed a carton of eggs, carefully inspecting for
cracks before heading to checkout. With a nod to the cashier, he paid and stepped back into the sun, feeling a quiet
satisfaction in the simple errand.
